This repository contains scripts to reproduce different
scenarios/use cases encountered while using git.

Every script has a short description at the top to explain
the use case or the scenario it reproduces.

If you want to contribute with new examples, you can use a copy of the
_template.sh_ file as starting point.

The _utils.sh_ file contains several methods for logging
information to the console or pause/abort the execution.
